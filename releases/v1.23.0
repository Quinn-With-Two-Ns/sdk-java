## Breaking Changes

### Workflow execution history default format changes

WorkflowExecutionHistory.toJson method now emit proper protobuf JSON fields in SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE rather
than PascalCase. Older versions of the Java SDK will not understand this format.
Users can revert to the old format by setting legacyFormat to true.

### HTTP/2 Keep Alive

HTTP/2 Keep alive is now enabled by default. This should help avoid request timeouts on previously idle connections.
If users want to revert to the old behavior they can set ServiceStubOptions.setEnableKeepAlive to false.

### Connection Options

Default retry options have been updated to match the core based SDKs. This should help with consistency across the SDKs.

## Bugfixes

* Dynamic workflows now consistently use context aware data converters.
* Workflow retry policy is now propagated during continue-as-new and to ContinueAsNewOptions.
