# Highlights

## Bugfixes

Add `WorkflowContext` more consistently in the SDK. `WorkflowContext` will now also be added in:

* Memo
* Last failure
* Schedules (Note: The `workflowId` in `WorkflowContext` may differ on serialization and deserialization.)

## (Experimental) Start delay

Added `StartDelay` option to `WorkflowOptions`. `StartDelay` will cause Temporal to wait before dispatching the first workflow task.
If the workflow gets a signal before the delay, a workflow task will be dispatched and the rest
of the delay will be ignored.
